# E-commerce Store

A **full-stack Django E-commerce Store** offering a complete online shopping experience—featuring user authentication, product catalog, shopping cart, secure checkout, and order management. Built with **Python**, **Django**, **SQLite**, and **Bootstrap**, this project highlights your expertise in backend logic, database design, and responsive UI development.

## ​ Why This Project Stands Out

- **Full-Stack Proficiency**: Demonstrates end-to-end development—from models and views to forms, templates, and deploy-ready static assets.
- **Business-Centric Features**: Incorporates essential e-commerce workflows: product listing, cart & checkout, and order tracking.
- **Scalable & Secure Foundation**: Built using Django’s batteries-included approach with SQLite for lightweight yet powerful development.
- **UI/UX-Ready Design**: Utilizes Bootstrap for a responsive, mobile-first interface.
- **Indian Hiring Focus**: Highlights skills in Django, relational database handling, CRUD operations, and user authentication—highly valued in Indian software roles.

##  Project Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure registration, login, and logout workflows utilizing Django’s auth system.
- **Product Catalog**: Admin interface to add/edit products; frontend display with product details.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add items, adjust quantities, and manage cart contents dynamically.
- **Checkout & Order Flow**: User order submission, confirmation, and status tracking.
- **Order Management**: Backend support for viewing, processing, and updating orders.
